## FAQ
### Will this work on \<insert platform and instance name here\>?
Focus is currently being put on just AWS EC2 g4dn.xlarge instances during development. As development continues, more platforms and Windows versions will be tested.

### I can't connect to my VM using Moonlight.
  You need to forward the ports on your machine. The ports you need to forward are 47984, 47989, 48010, 47990 TCP and 47998, 47999, 48000, 48010 UDP. If you're having more problems try downloading the [Moonlight Internet Streaming Tool](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/Internet-Hosting-Tool/releases) and troubleshooting it. The latest release of sunshine (0.8.0) now also supports UPnP which may forward required ports automatically if supported by your network adapter.

### How do
  You can visit the web control panel via the desktop shortcut once installed. You will need your login credentials which you are prompted for during installation.
